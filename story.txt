IT WAS AROUND 11:20 THAT NIGHT. I WAS DRAGGING MYSELF HOME EXHAUSTED AFTER A TIRING[a] NIGHT-STUDY SESSION OF JAVASCRIPT[n].$$ON MY WAY, I WAS LISTENING TO EMINEM[n] AND DREAMING TO SLEEP[v] WHEN I REACH HOME. I WAS SO HUNGRY AND WANTED TO COOK RAMEN[n]. MY COOKING SKILLS ARE HORRIBLE[a]. I DON'T HAVE MANY FRIENDS. PEOPLE ALWAYS DESCRIBE ME AS A/AN LONER[a] $$SHE WAS WEARING DIRTY[a] PINK[a] PIJAMAS AND LOOKED AS IF ALL HER JOINTS IN HER BODY HAD BEEN TWISTED. SHE WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO RUN[v] WITH THESE LIMBS...WORSE, HER HAIR WAS A MESS AND STICKING OUT TO EVERYWHERE. IT SEEMED SO WEIRD[a] SO I STOPPED WALKING
