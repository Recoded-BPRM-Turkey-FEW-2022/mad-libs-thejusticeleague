Louis[n] went[v] to the store[n], and it was fun[a]. He taught[v] the class[n].

In my dream, I was in a adjective[a] city named cityName[n] where robots outnumbered humans. I found myself in an underground bunker with the few remaining people. My adjective[a] friend name[n] and I were spending most of our days by learning to act like robots and doing verb[v] so that the robots wouldn't understand that we are humans. We were not allowed to go out alone. The robots out there had a specific feature different than humans. When they spoke, only aDrink[n] came out of their mouths. That's why we were secretly drinking aDrink[n] outside all the time to act like them.
